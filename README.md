## Customer Segmentation and RFM Modeling 
- Using RFM anaylsis and K-means Clustering, we created the below Clusters or segments of customers to further give targetted recommendation to them.

- We can Upsell high end products to Big Spenders and Cross Sell complimentary products to **Loyal** and **Best Customer (VVIP)**.

- Potential Loyalists: They are highly potential to enter our loyal customer segments, discounts for future purchases are very suitable for this audience.

- Lagging Customers: Let’s target them with their wishlist items, a limited time offer discount and/or a free delivery.

- Hibernating Almost Lost: They made some initial purchase but have not seen them since. Let’s spend some resource to build our brand awareness with them.

- Churned Customers: Poorest performers of our RFM model. They might have went with our competitors for now and will require a different activation strategy to win them back. We can see many things to improve our business through surveying this customer group.
