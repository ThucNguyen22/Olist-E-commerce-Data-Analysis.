## Recency , Frequency , Monetary Analysis
In this project , I am using a behavioral customer segmentation method, which is the RFM analysis.</br>
The RFM segments customers based on 3 main components : 
- **Recency** : How much time has elapsed since the customers last activity or transaction with the Brand?
- **Frequency** : How often has a customer transacted or interacted with the brand during a particular period of time? 
- **Monetary** : Also referred to as “monetary value,” this factor reflects how much a customer has spent with the brand during a particular period of time.
## Why RFM Works
According to Arthur Hughes from the Database Marketing Institute, Customers who have purchased from you recently are more likely to respond to your next promotion than those whose last purchase was further in the past. This is a universal principle which has been found to be true in almost all industries: insurance, banks, cataloging, retail, travel, etc. It is also true that frequent buyers are more likely to respond than less frequent buyers. Big spenders often respond better than low spenders. <br>
By identifying these big spenders, we can focus our marketing efforts to these big spenders to make good returns.
